# Personal MPRI lecture notes

Note those are my personal lecture notes of some classes I'm attending. I do not guarantee they are always complete or even correct.

Moreover, I'm not editing lecture notes for all classes I'm attending. For others, I simply refer to the slides and the existing lecture notes (if applicable).

## Typst template

General theme and custom callouts are defined in [`utils.typ`](utils.typ).
